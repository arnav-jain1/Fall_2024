# Formal languages and Finite State Machines
3 forms of theory
* Complexity theory (why are some problems computationally hard and others easy)
* Computability theory (what problems are solvable vs not solvable)
* Automata Theory (definitions and properties of mathmatical models of computation)
	* Finite automata is one model
	* Used in text-processing, hardware design, compiles

# Definitions
Computation
* Execution of a self-contained procedure that processes input without outside intervention once it starts, and eventually halts yielding output that corresponds to input given
* "black box"
Procedure
* A computing mechanism we call an abstract machine; theoretical model allowing for precise analysis of how a system functions
* some underlying mathematical model
Algorithms 
* Computation that **Always** halts
Language
* A set of strings with some inherent structure used to express a computation



## Kleene Star
Imagine you have a set of letters (or strings) $\{a,b\}$. The kleene star group is the infinite set of all of the possible combinations created by the elements of the group so:
$V^{*}= \sum^{*}= \{ \lambda, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, ...\}$

We can do operations on these languages so let 
$$x = bab, y = abbaab $$
- Length: |x| = 3
- Concatenation: $xy = bababbaab$
- Repetition: $x^{3} = babbabbab$, $x^{0} = \lambda$
- Reversal: $y^{R} = baabba$
- Kleene Star: $x^{*}=\{\lambda,bab,babbab,...\}, \{\lambda, x, xx, xxx\}$

Example: Kleene star of $S = \{x,y\}$ where
$$x = bab, y = abbaab $$
$S^{*} = \{\lambda, x, y, xx, yx, xy, xxx,...\}$
$S^{*} = \{\lambda, bab, abbaab, babbab, abbaabbab, bababbaab, babbabbab...\}$
**Note:** order matters where you order by length first and then alphabetical order (why yy is after xxx and why xy is after yx)
**Note 2:** You also have to define alphabetical order

Example2: Given the alphabet $\sum = \{a,b\}$ and $S = \{aa,ab,ba,bb\}$
generate $S^{*}$
$$S^{*}=\{\lambda, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaaa, aaab, aaba, aabb, abaa,...\}
$$
Note: referring $S^{*} = L_{e}$ 
You can generate all possible strings in $L_{e}$ using a set of substitution roles called **formal grammar**. 
$$E \rightarrow \lambda | aO | bO$$
$$ O \rightarrow aE | bE$$
How to make $baaa$ using formal grammar
$$E \Rightarrow bO \Rightarrow baE \Rightarrow baaO \Rightarrow baaaE \Rightarrow baaa\lambda$$

Another formal grammar:
$$E \rightarrow \lambda \space|\space aaE \space| abE \space| \space baE \space| \space bbE$$
# Finite state machine

Create a machine using grammar of $L_{e}$
We need 2 states: E and O
Our first state is E
$$ \rightarrow E \space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space O$$
We can go between states?
