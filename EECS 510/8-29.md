# Formal languages and Finite State Machines
3 forms of theory
* Complexity theory (why are some problems computationally hard and others easy)
* Computability theory (what problems are solvable vs not solvable)
* Automata Theory (definitions and properties of mathmatical models of computation)
	* Finite automata is one model
		* Used in text-processing, hardware design, compiles
