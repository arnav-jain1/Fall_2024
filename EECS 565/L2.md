# Key concepts and why
Hacking is becoming easier due to more tools being made available
	Metaploit, NSA tools, Kali

Defense side
	overlooked and crime underreported
	Law is behind the times and lawmakers dont understand the technology 

Security:
	Each of these have different levels, only the top level is being described
	Confidentiality
		High: Data only available to those legally allowed to see it (grades, health records)
		How?: encryption, permission control, anonymity (can view records but not see name)
		Moderate, and low also exist
	Integrity
		Trust that the data is accurate
		If tampered, need to be able to find where
		How?: Signature, edit history, logs
	availability 
		Need to be able to access at all times
		Plane systems
		How?: Request response, allocation of resources, fault tolerant
	Authenticity, authorization, accountability, and privacy

Goal of cybersec is also to protect the valuables
Valuables:
	Customer info, banking details, money
	Hardware, code, data
Anything can be targeted from any way (target hardware thru software)

## Threat vs vulnerability 
Vulnerability: security weakness that can be exploited
	Crack in foundation is the vulnerability
Threat: circumstances that can lead to loss/harm
	Rainwater is the threat
	Can be:
		Benign or malicious
		mistake vs failure vs attack
		Human or computer initiated
Attack: Exploit vulnerabilites by threats

Vulnerability is what can be exploited (open port) while threat is what can do the exploiting (malicious packet)


Control: Protective measure
	**Threat** blocked by **control** of **vulnerability**

# Vulnerability and risk assesment
## Hardware vulnerabilities
Easiest to deal with 
	remove/change device
	Pull the plug
	reboot

Personal devices can also have vulnerabilities

## Software vulnerabilities 
Break software
Modify to do something different (salami attack)
Delete or steal software

Life cycle of soft vuln:
	Born (while developing software)
	Discovered but not patched (zero-day vulnerability)
	Patched
0-days are worth a lot of money

## Data vuln
Data understood by poeple (ie storing in plain text)
	Dont need physical access (HW vuln)
	Dont need computer skills (SW vuln)
Very valuable (company/client info)
Damaging if tampered with

Compromised by 
	Wiretaps
	bugs in output
	Bugs in input (keylogger)
	Monitoring electromagnetic rad
	just asking

Data is sometimes only valuable for a short time (awards announcements) 
***Principal of adequate protection***: Items protected (to the degree that is consistent with their valeu) until they lose their value
	If something is expensive, protect it expensively until it no longer is

## Attacking
Attack surface: Full set of vulnerabilities (actual or potential)
Attack tree: DS representing vulnerabilities and techniques for exploiting them

# Adversaries 
Potential adversaries 
	Script kiddies: people who download and use tools but dont know how they work 
	Amateurs: Average user that stumbles on a vuln
	Crackers: People who hack for the challenge
	Career criminals: people who hack for profit (groups, terrorists)
	Users with skills: Design and implement tools (white hat)

### Insiders
Most defense is external which makes it more vulnerable for internal attacks 
	Firewalls: protect against outside but not inside
Trojan horses, leakers, etc

### Attacks
Method: Skills, knowledge, tools
Opportunity: Time, vulnerability
Motive: Gains
Goal is to eliminate at least one

Intruder will use any method of penetration so the site might not be obvious 
Not always where the strongest defense is (attackers look for weakest spot)

# Security design principles
## Defense
Ways:
	Prevent: close the vulnerability
	Deter: Make it harder to attack
	Deflect: Make another target more attractive
	Mitigate: Make the attack effect less severe
	Detect: Know when the attack occurs
Controls:
	Physical: Stop attacks using something physical (locks, guards, backups)
	Admin/procedure: Teach people how to react (laws, policies like passwords)
	Technical: Counter threats with tech (HW/SW) 
		Hardware: firewalls, user ID, smart cards
		Software: OS/network/program access control, antivirus, encryption,
Must be easy to use, effecient, effective

Defense in depth:
	Multi layered approach so if first line fails, program is still safe
	Defense spread out and decentralized with redundancy 
	For HW,SW, policies, personal etc.

Security is no stronger than the weakest link, all it takes is one vuln
