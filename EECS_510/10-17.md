# Pushdown automata (PDA)
accept context free languages
	Diff between non-deterministic and deterministic
	Some CFL are inherently non-deterministic

A string in the PDA must end with an accepting state with an empty stack with only one symbol popped from the stack at a time
For the PDA with aabb:

| State | Input     | Stack     |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| $q_0$ | aabb      | $\lambda$ |
| $q_0$ | abb       | X         |
| $q_0$ | bb        | XX        |
| $q_1$ | b         | X         |
| $q_1$ | $\lambda$ | $\lambda$ |
Can also use symbols instead of table
$\vdash$  is a yield, indicates a step in the machine
$(q_{0}, aabb, \lambda) \vdash (q_{0}, abb, X) \vdash (q_{0}, bb, XX) \vdash (q_{1}, b, X) \vdash (q_{1}, \lambda, \lambda)$  
$\vdash^{*}$ means yields in multiple steps so it allows us to use shorthand
$(q_{0}, aabb, \lambda) \vdash^{*} (q_{1}, \lambda, \lambda)$  

SO the goal for PDA is always:
$(q_{0}, s, \lambda) \vdash^{*} (q_{f}, \lambda, \lambda)$ where s is start string and f is final state

## Definition
PDA is a finite state machine with a stack and has the following properties:
- Q= set of states, one of which is the start and a subset which is the final
- $\sum$ is the input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet (can include $\Sigma$) 
- $\delta$: $Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\lambda\}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{\lambda\})$ : Finite subsets of Q and Gamma where given a state from and (optionally) a char from $\Sigma$ and (optionally) an char from stack $\Gamma$, determines the next state of the machine and the string from $\Gamma$ to put on the stack

### Example 2
Draw a PDA that accepts palindromes of as and bs with c in the middle that are odd
$\delta = \{((q_{0}, a, \lambda), (q_{0}, X)),\quad ((q_{0}, b, \lambda), (q_{0}, Y)), ((c, \}$

There are also ways to make PDAs more deterministic

First, use $ to denote the end of a language

So building abbaba$ would look like this

| State | Input     | Stack     |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| $q_0$ | abbaba$   | $\lambda$ |
| $q_1$ | abbaba$   | S         |
| $q_1$ | bbaba$    | XS        |
| $q_1$ | baba$     | S         |
| $q_1$ | aba$      | YS        |
| $q_1$ | ba$       | S         |
| $q_1$ | a$        | YS        |
| $q_1$ | $         | S         |
| $q_1$ | $\lambda$ | $\lambda$ |

The first 3 functions are unique but function 4 has same state, same input, with different stack and output (when compared to 1). Function 5 has same state as 3, can also take B, but has different output and stack.


## Definition
PDA is deterministic if for every $q \in Q$ (every state in set of states), for every $c \in \Sigma$ (every letter in the alphabet), and every $X \in \Gamma$ (every stack var in stack alphabet), there is exactly ONE of the following transitions
- $\delta(q,c,X)$ 
- $\delta(q,c,\lambda)$ 
- $\delta(q,\lambda,X)$ 
- $\delta(q,\lambda,\lambda)$ 
which makes sense because there the output of state, letter must be unique and then lambdas introduce non-determinism
