Include: 
	Q: A set of all states including the start state and a subset of accepting states
	$\sum\limits$: Alphabet (all valid strings)
	$\delta$: $Q X (\sum \cup \lambda \rightarrow 2^{Q})$: function that when given an input symbol (potentially $\lambda$) determines next possible states that are possible (aka power set)

If Q = $\{q_{0}, q_{1}\}$, $2^{Q}= \{\phi, \{q_{0}\}, \{q_{1}\}, \{q_{0}, q_{1}\}\}$  
Differences between NFA and DFA
1. $\lambda$ is valid input
2. More than one possible state with 1 input
3. possible no transitions exist (jail)

Convert this to DFA
First, make a table
NFA table:

| State | a      | b      |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| q0    | q1     | q2     |
| q1    | q1,q3  | q1     |
| q2    | q2,q3  | q3     |
| +q3   | $\phi$ | $\phi$ |
\+ denotes accepting state
DFA table

| State | a     | b   |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| q0    | q1    | q2  |
| q1    | q1q3  | q1  |
| +q1q3 | q1,q3 | q1  |
| q2    | q2q3  | q2  |
| +q2q3 | q2q3  | q3  |
So make a table for DFA, then every unique state becomes its own row

So for a\*ac\*b\*

NFA table

| State | a        | b   | c    |
| ----- | -------- | --- | ---- |
| q0    | q0,q1,q2 |     |      |
| q1    |          |     | q1q2 |
| +q2   |          | q2  |      |
DFA table

| State   | a        | b   | c    |
| ------- | -------- | --- | ---- |
| q0      | q0,q1,q2 |     |      |
| +q0q1q2 | q0q2q2   | q2  | q1q2 |
| +q1q2   |          | q2  | q1q2 |
| +q2     |          | q2  |      |
Blanks are null in DFAs, all nulls go to jail state

Complement: Can't complement NFA, have to go to dfa first
	Because NFAs omit possibilities, (doesnt include not accepted which is what we are trying to include in the complement)
### Note IF stuck: NFA->Table-> DFA
# Distinguishable DFA (optimizing)
It is possible to collapse states if they are indistinguishable for example: 
![[Pasted image 20240917132951.png]]
can become 
![[Pasted image 20240917132957.png]]
which can then become 
![[Pasted image 20240917133033.png]]

Two states are distinguishable if:
	One and only one of the 2 of the states are in an accepting state
	The states $\delta(q_{1}, c)$ and $\delta(q_{2},c)$ are distinguishable for at least one symbol c $\in \sum$. The transitions out of q1 and and q2 are different (I think)

For the example above, create a table of all possible pairings
$(q_{0},q_{1}),(q_{0},q_{2}),(q_{0},q_{3}),(q_{1},q_{2}),(q_{1},q_{3}),(q_{2},q_{3})$ 
Note: The NA represents duplicates

| ---- | q1  | q2   | q3   |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| q0   |     | dist | dist |
| q1   | NA  | dist | dist |
| q2   | NA  | NA   |      |
NOTE: NOTICE THE OFFSET
q1,q0 with q2,q3 distinguishable because accepting
Then you check to make sure that the output of each state is the same or not, if it is the same, market it good *for now*
$\delta(q_{0}, a) = q_{1} \quad \delta(q_{1}, a) = q_{1}: \quad (q_{0},q_{1}) = ND$
$\delta(q_{0}, b) = q_{2} \quad \delta(q_{1}, b) = q_{2}: \quad (q_{0}, q_{1}) = ND$
$\therefore (q_{1}, q_{2}) = ND$

$\delta(q_{2}, a) = q_{3} \quad \delta(q_{3}, 1) = q_{3}: \quad (q_{2},q_{3}) = ND$
$\delta(q_{2}, b) = q_{3} \quad \delta(q_{3}, b) = q_{3}: \quad (q_{2}, q_{3}) = ND$
$\therefore (q_{2}, q_{3}) = ND$

So step one, make the table
Then step 2 is to put all check marks where one is accepting and other is not

Try with this
![[Pasted image 20240917133337.png]]


|     | q1   | q2   | q3   | q4   | q5   | q6   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| q0  | dist | dist | D    | D    | dist | dist |
| q1  | N/A  |      | dist | dist | D    | D    |
| q2  | N/A  | N/A  | dist | dist | D    | D    |
| q3  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  |      | dist | dist |
| q4  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | dist | dist |
| q5  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  |      |
$\{q_{0}, q_{3}\}$
$\delta(q_{0},0) = q_{1}, \delta(q_{3},0) = q_{5}$  and since q1 and q5 is ND so far, ND
$\delta(q_{0},1) = q_{2}, \delta(q_{3},1) = q_{3}: (q_{2}, q_{3})$  which is dist so we know q0,q3 is dist
Repeat and leave all distinguishable ones blank 
Eventually, $(q_{1},q_{2}), q_{3},q_{4}, q_{5},q_{6}$ are ND
So it becomes

DFAs good because:
	Straightforward to implement
	Many useful scenarios
NFAs good because:
	Easier to design
	Difficult to implement
	Can be converted
For every language, there is a unique DFA with minimal number of states
Definitions: 
1. Regular expressions
	a) $\emptyset$: represents empty language/set {}
	b) $\lambda$: Represents one-string language/set {$\lambda$}
	c) c: for each char c in alphabet $\sum\limits$ representing the language/set {c}
2. for reg ex $r,r_{1}, r_{2}$ the following are also regex: 
	a) $r_{1}r_{2}$ concatenation 
	b) $r^{*}$ Kleene Star
	c) $r_{1}+r_{2}$ union
	d) (r) grouping

Making a\*ac\*b\*
- a,b, and c are refex by 1c
- a*, b*, c* are regex by 2b
- a\*\*ac\*b\* is a regex by concat

Write regex that contains aba
$$(a+b)^{*}aba(a+b)^{*}$$
FOr proofs, prove smallest element (letters) are regex
Then prove that Klene stars, union, Kleene star, grouping are regex. Make sure to go big to small so in this case
a, b
aba concat
union
grouping 
Kleene star
