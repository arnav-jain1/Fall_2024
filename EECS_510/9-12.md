# Distinguishable DFA (optimizing)
Two states are distinguishable if:
	One and only one of the states are in an accepting state
	The states $\delta(q_{1}, c)$ and $\delta(q_{2},c)$ are distinguishable for at least one symbol c $\in \sum$. The transitions out of q1 and and q2 are different (I think)

First create a table of the possible pairings of states 
$(q_{0},q_{1}),(q_{0},q_{2}),(q_{0},q_{3}),(q_{1},q_{2}),(q_{1},q_{3}),(q_{2},q_{3})$ 
Note: The NA represents duplicates

| ---- | q1  | q2   | q3   |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| q0   |     | dist | dist |
| q1   | NA  | dist | dist |
| q2   | NA  | NA   |      |
q1,q0 with q2,q3 distinguishable because accepting

$\delta(q_{0}, a) = q_{1} \quad \delta(q_{1}, a) = q_{1}: \quad (q_{0},q_{1}) = ND$
$\delta(q_{0}, b) = q_{2} \quad \delta(q_{1}, b) = q_{2}: \quad (q_{0}, q_{1}) = ND$
$\therefore (q_{1}, q_{2}) = ND$

$\delta(q_{2}, a) = q_{3} \quad \delta(q_{3}, 1) = q_{3}: \quad (q_{2},q_{3}) = ND$
$\delta(q_{2}, b) = q_{3} \quad \delta(q_{3}, b) = q_{3}: \quad (q_{2}, q_{3}) = ND$
$\therefore (q_{2}, q_{3}) = ND$

So step one, make the table
Then step 2 is to put all check marks where one is accepting and other is not

Definitions: 
1. Regular expressions
	a) $\emptyset$: represents empty language/set {}
	b) $\lambda$: Represents one-string language/set {$\lambda$}
	c) c: for each char c in alphabet $\sum\limits$ representing the language/set {c}
2. for reg ex $r,r_{1}, r_{2}$ the following are also regex: 
	a) $r_{1}r_{2}$ concatenation 
	b) $r^{*}$ Kleene Star
	c) $r_{1}+r_{2}$ union
	d) (r) grouping

Making a\*ac\*b\*
- a,b, and c are refex by 1c
- a*, b*, c* are regex by 2b
- a\*\*ac\*b\* is a regex by concat

Write regex that contains aba
$$(a+b)^{*}aba(a+b)^{*}$$
FOr proofs, prove smallest element (letters) are regex
Then prove that Klene stars, union, Kleene star, grouping are regex. Make sure to go big to small so in this case
a, b
aba concat
union
grouping 
Kleene star
