1. Length of petals, length of sepals, width of petals, width of sepals
2. Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica
3. We can use supervised learning, input the 4 lengths and then make a prediction. If the predicition is correct, then we continue, if it is incorrect then we modify the weights. One example could be a forest. For example, we add the lengths and widths and depending on if it is greater than, less than, or in the middle of two arbitrary weights, we classify it accordingly. we can then adjust the weights to be more accurate
4. We can use a confusion matrix to see true positive/negative, and false positive/negative. We can also use Precision, Recall, and F1-Score as well as different data for testing and training.
