1. 2^8=256 * .1 = 25.6seconds
2. {a, b, c} and {a,b,d} b) {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d}
3. a) {b} and {d} b) {b,a}, {b,c}, {d,a}, {d,c}
4. Y= {a,b,f,g,h}
5. b) The next step is to remove a feature from Y then evaluate with each possible subset and then whichever one scores the best, you repeat this step (if it scores better)
