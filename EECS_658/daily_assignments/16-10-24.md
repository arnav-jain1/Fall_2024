1a. $2 * 0.12 + 3 * 0.18 + 7 * .21 + 2 * .18 + 9 * .17 + 4 * .14=4.7$ 
1b. $median = \frac{3+4}{2}=3.5$ 
2. A and B, A and C, A and D, B and C, B and D, C and D
3. 
	$P(A) = P_{1}(A) * P_{2}(A) = .6*.7=.42$
	$P(B) = P_{1}(B) * P_{3}(B) = .4*.5=.2$
	$P(C) = P_{2}(C) * P_{3}(C) = .3*.5=.15$
	classified as A because highest P so
