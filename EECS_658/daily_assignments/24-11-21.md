| 0   | -1  | -1  | -1  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  |
| -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  |
| -1  | -1  | -1  | 0   |

k=2
For square 2, 5, 12, 15
	$max[(-1 + 0 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1)] = -1$  
For square others excluding 1, 16
	$max[(-1 + 1 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1), (-1 + 1 * -1)] = -2$  

| 0   | -1  | -2  | -2  |

| -1  | -2  | -2  | -2  |
| -2  | -2  | -2  | -1  |
| -2  | -2  | -1  | 0   |

k=3
Since it takes the max, only squares 4, 7, 10, 13 will be different
	$max[(-1 + 1 * -2), (-1 + 1 * -2), (-1 + 1 * -2), (-1 + 1 * -2)] = -3$  

| 0   | -1  | -2  | -3  |

| -1  | -2  | -3  | -2  |
| -2  | -3  | -2  | -1  |
| -3  | -2  | -1  | 0   |

Will stay same for k=4

| 0   | -1  | -2  | -3  |

| -1  | -2  | -3  | -2  |
| -2  | -3  | -2  | -1  |
