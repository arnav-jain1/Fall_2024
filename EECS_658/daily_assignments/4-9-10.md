1. MAtrix B because the covariance on the diagonal is all 1 and the rest of the covariences are 0 so that means it is independant
2. Matric C because in matrix C The covariance of a/b with c is always 0 and the variance of C is 1 but the covariance of a,b is .1 so there is a little dependence there.
3. Matricies A and C show interdependence between a,b because the covariance in both is >0 which means there is some dependence.
4. $$\sqrt{(3-1)^{2}+(8-4)^{2}+(2-8)^{2}} = \sqrt{4+16+26} = \sqrt{56} \approx7.48$$
5. Cat because the 3 nearest neighbors are Cat (3.9), Cat (7.5), Dog (12.5). Since 2 cats appear and 1 dog appears, Cat is the classification for k = 3
