# OS services for user
- User interface- Almost all OS have some sort of UI
	- CLI
	- GUI
	- Touch screen
- Program execution- load in memory and a run a program
	- End it, normally or with error
- IO operations: interact with IO safely and effeciently 
- File system manipulation: provide access to mass storage
	- make, del, read, write dir/files
	- search file info
	- permission management
- Interprocess communication- exchange info among processes 
	- shared memory, POSIX (standard for design of UNIX OS)
	- message parsing, Microkernel, OS, RPC, COBRA
- Error detection: aware of possible errors
	- CPU and memory (power, fault)
	- IO (network connection, wire faulty)
	- user program (seg fault, div by 0)
# OS Services for efficient system operation
- resource allocation: provide access to shared resources in multiuser system
	- CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, IO
- Accounting: keep track of system resource usage
	- For cost accounting and usage stats
- Protection and security
	- Ensure access to system resources is controlled (protection)
	- Prevent outsiders from accessing system (security)
	- auth, file perms, address space restrictions

# Sys call
- Program interface to services in the OS
	- Request kernel mode service from the OS
	- Written in C/C++ usually (high level systems languages)
- Accessed by programs via API (high level) 
	- Simpler interface
	- Reduces coupling because syscalls are dependant on the system so the application is more portable
		- POSIX API (all unix)
		- Win 32/64 for windows (why there is a 32 and 64bit)
	- Implemented via trap
		- Register contains syscall number
		- syscall allows for the control to be transferred to the terminal fast
