# Quiz 1

## Q 3:
The OS can provide more efficient operation compared to a multitasking OS
Correct Answer:T
	*Context switching*


## Q 4
The OS uses the address space protection mechanism to:
	ensure applications do not crash into each other
	    T
	ensure applications do not crash into the OS
		F
		*This is why there is a dual mode*

## Q 5
The memory location of the interrupt vector table (IVT) must be known toÂ  the OS, but not necessarily to the CPU.
	False
	OS tells CPU so CPU can find it, they both know

## Q6
After startup, the operating system is idle until there is an interrupt.
	False
	*OS waits*

1. syscall is faster than trap because syscall is simpler and designed to be effecient
2. Yes because stack is used as well
![[Pasted image 20241004141626.png]]
3. Yes because it uses a syscall to get it, if it didnt then it would not cause a mode switch
4. Yes, fork()

5. Obv
6. System programs are programs shipped *with* the OS, A-D are GCC. Loader is part of the OS. Another way to think about it is that you can remove system programs, you can't remove a loader

7. True and true(why you do sudo apt install)
8. Text: where binary code there is so thats where the cpu is reading the program from. Data: Global and static vars. Both of these are known at compiletime. Stack and heap can change during runtime

1. Entire address space is cloned but the PID has to be different

![[Pasted image 20241004142451.png]]
2. 1. Running to wait is IO or event wait 2. IF it uses its time slice it goes back to ready so interrupt

![[Pasted image 20241004142719.png]]
1. Because the parent is waiting the child can wait
2. Printed 0 times
3. fork after begin so only once
![[Pasted image 20241004142920.png]]
1. for the parent rvalue is child ID (20) and for the child process it is 0 so False
2. True
![[Pasted image 20241004143032.png]]
1. False, only cleans when program finishes
2. Register state saved in memory

1. a
2. False, reading or writing to shared memory does not need syscalls, attaching does
3. True shared memory is faster bc less syscall
4. Technically yes (example in the slides)
5. F it blocks
![[Pasted image 20241004143614.png]]
1. True, makes a FIFO file
2. False, it can only access one end

![[Pasted image 20241004143708.png]]
7. pipe becomes new stdin (stdin is 0 and stdout is 1). Close closes old stdin
![[Pasted image 20241004143815.png]]
1. Need to open a pipe
2. Nothing yet
3. Then you need to send a signal to the pipe so write to 1 (1 is stdout)
4. wait for std in so read from pipe (0 is stdin)
5. Then You are done so do nothing or close
6. Again do nothing
