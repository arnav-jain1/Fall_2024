# OS
Intermediate between user and hardware
	Easy and efficient execution 
Only specialized systems that have one task don't need an OS (baremetal)
## For users
Easier to write programs, more powerful than ISA
Makes it easier to run programs (like loading program into memory, initialize program state and maintain a program counter, stopping)
	Memory is what process can directly access
security, resource management, performance

## For systems
Allocates resources
	Manage CPU, memory, files, IO, network, etc.
	Resolve conflicts from multiple programs wanting to use the same thing
## Computer system
Hardware 
	Basic computing resources (Memory, IO, CPU, etc)
OS
	Controls use of hardware amongst multiple resources 
Application programs
	Define how system resources solve problems of the user (compilers, web browsers, video games)
Users

### Startup
Bootstrap program to start computer
	Initialize CPU registers, device controllers, memory, locate and load OS kernel
OS then starts executing the first program
	Each process called a daemon (starting with 1), located in memory
	waits for an event (interrupt driven)
Occurrence of an interrupt (exceptions/traps)
	processor checks for interrupt happening
	transfers control to interrupt service routine, usually through interrupt vector table (IVT, EECS388!)
		IVT in fixed address in memory
	Execute the associated interrupt service routine
	return control to the interrupted program	

Hides complexity and limitations of hardware (creates hardware interface). Simpler more, powerful abstraction (OS interface)

On boot, bootstrap locates and loads OS into memory
OS waits for events
